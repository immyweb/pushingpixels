# PushingPixels.co.uk

My personal portfolio website (http://pushingpixels.co.uk/). 

This was a fun project built on the webstarterpack (https://github.com/immyweb/webstarterpack). I wanted to explore different animation techniques, such as parallax scolling and SVG animations using GSAP, whilst being responsive.
